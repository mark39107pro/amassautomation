# amass automation
# automate amass
# simply run python amass.py 

:requirements are mentioned below

automate amass for large targets
 
passive enumeration is faster and there might be many false positives so use http-probe  (time.sleep(120)) in seconds


for active enumeration use more seconds (3600)
edit mode from passive to active in config.ini 

my config for amass is here  - https://github.com/mark39107pro/amassconfig.git
